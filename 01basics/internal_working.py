     ----------------------internal working python------------

     __pycache__ is a byte code which is always formed but is mostly hidden
       
     lines of code in python -----> byte code ------> python virtual machine(gets installed with python jaha program run hota hai)

     byte code : is a low level code which runs faster than original python code kyuki already woh convert ho chuka syntax shi hai ye bhi check ho chuka hai


     byte code is not machine code and it is specifically for python

     byte code is python specific

     .pyc : compiled python (frozen binaries)

     __pycache__(sysytem folder): ab koi bhi change kroge program toh har baar nyi pyc banti hai unsabko ek jagah rakhne ke liye python makes a folder for itself . Mostly jaha bhi _ _ xyz _ _ (2 underscore hotey hai) that is mostly made by python for itself

     hello_world.cpython-312.pyc : 312 is the version and it works only for imported files mtlb jab kuch import karoge tabhi ye aayega normal code mei kuch nhi hoga


     PVM(python virtual machine):
       run time engine
       ismey loop chalta rehta hai jaisey hi a file is fed to it it executes
       interpreted
       aap python code bhi de saktey ho not only byte code


    MACHINE CODE: is directly instruction to apple/ intel chip
